Summary     : A GNU arbitrary precision library
Description :
The gmp package contains GNU MP, a library for arbitrary precision
arithmetic, signed integers operations, rational numbers and floating
point numbers. GNU MP is designed for speed, for both small and very
large operands. GNU MP is fast because it uses fullwords as the basic
arithmetic type, it uses fast algorithms, it carefully optimizes
assembly code for many CPUs' most common inner loops, and it generally
emphasizes speed over simplicity/elegance in its operations.

Install the gmp package if you need a fast arbitrary precision
library.

Summary     : The GNU macro processor
Description :
A GNU implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor.  M4 is
useful for writing text files which can be logically parsed, and is used
by many programs as part of their build process.  M4 has built-in
functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic,
etc.  The autoconf program needs m4 for generating configure scripts, but
not for running configure scripts.

Install m4 if you need a macro processor.
