=> This package requires additional configuration for use in editors. Install package 'user-setup', or manually:

   * for Emacs, add these lines to ~/.emacs:
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/opam/.opam/4.08/share/emacs/site-lisp")
     (require 'ocp-indent)

   * for Vim, add this line to ~/.vimrc:
     set rtp^="/home/opam/.opam/4.08/share/ocp-indent/vim"
# Run eval $(opam env) to update the current shell environment

The former state can be restored with:
    opam switch import "/home/opam/.opam/4.08/.opam-switch/backup/state-20180726201931.export"
