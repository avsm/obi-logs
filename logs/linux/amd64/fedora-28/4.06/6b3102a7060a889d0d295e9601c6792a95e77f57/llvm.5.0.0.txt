Summary     : The GNU macro processor
Description :
A GNU implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor.  M4 is
useful for writing text files which can be logically parsed, and is used
by many programs as part of their build process.  M4 has built-in
functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic,
etc.  The autoconf program needs m4 for generating configure scripts, but
not for running configure scripts.

Install m4 if you need a macro processor.

Summary     : An interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
Description :
Python 2 is an old version of the language that is incompatible with the 3.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the
3.x line.

Note that documentation for Python 2 is provided in the python2-docs
package.

This package provides the "python2" executable; most of the actual
implementation is within the "python2-libs" package.
